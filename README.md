### Hey, I’m Ramit (aka `ramituncc49er`) 👋

- I am interested at problems with **statistical ML** and **deep learning**, especially anything in **NLP** and **LLMs**.  
- 👀 Right now I’m diving deeper into **RAG** and **AI agents** – trying to make models that don’t just sound smart, but actually *use* information smartly.
