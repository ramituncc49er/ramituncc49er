### Hey, I’m Ramit (aka `ramituncc49er`) 👋

- Interested in problems for **statistical ML** and **deep learning**, especially anything in **NLP** and **LLMs**.
- My work during my master’s thesis focused on **serendipitous recommendations** using LLMs (introduced ATARS, a novel framework).
- Currently diving deeper into scalable system designs for **RAG**-based and **Agentic AI** applications.
